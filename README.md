# A Little More Custom

üëã Hey Craft friends! Thanks for checking out my talk, [‚ÄúA Little More Custom‚Äù](https://craftcms.com/events/dot-all-2023/sessions/a-little-more-custom), which I gave at Dot All 2023 in Barcelona!

As a supplement, this repository provides working examples of all the functionality covered in the talk. Most of the customizations live inside a helpers module
in `modules/helpers`. If you want to run the site, I've also included a CLI command to generate a small bit of content to help illustrate some of the examples, which you can find in the Installation section.

## Element Actions

I've created two example actions based on my examples in the talk.

### Refresh from HRIS

An example ‚ÄúRefresh from HRIS‚Äù action is registered on the `User` element and can be triggered by selecting one or more users from the Users index. The external sync logic for
refreshing each user from the external system would live in the `performAction()` method on the action class.

- [modules/helpers/elements/actions/RefreshFromHRIS.php](modules/helpers/elements/actions/RefreshFromHRIS.php)

### Request Content Update

A functional ‚ÄúRequest Content Update‚Äù action is registered on the `Entry` element and can be triggered by selecting one or more entries from an entries index. The `performAction()`
method on the action class collects the selected entries from the provided `$query` parameter, and queues a `SendEntryUpdateEmail` job for each user. Each job is then responsible
for finding the author of the provided entry ID, and sending the message with links to that entry on the front-end and in the control panel.

- [modules/helpers/jobs/SendEntryUpdateEmail.php](modules/helpers/jobs/SendEntryUpdateEmail.php)

## Twig Extensions

I've included the actual extensions from the two examples I mentioned in the talk.

### Hostname Filter

The Hostname Extension provides a single `hostname` filter, which is a passthrough for PHP's `parse_url()` function with the `PHP_URL_HOST` component.

```twig
{{ 'https://craftcms.com/docs' | hostname }} {# craftcms.com #}
```

- [modules/helpers/web/twig/HostnameExtension.php](modules/helpers/web/twig/HostnameExtension.php)

### Icon Extension

The Icon Extension provides a single `icon` function, which accepts either the name of an icon that lives in `resources/icons` or an `Asset`, and an array of HTML attributes to modify on the SVG markup.

```twig
{{ icon('pencil-square', { class: 'w-4 h-4' }) }} 
```

- [modules/helpers/web/twig/IconExtension.php](modules/helpers/web/twig/IconExtension.php)

## Behaviors

I‚Äôve included a behavior based on the example I used in the talk.

### Date Range Behavior

The ‚ÄúDate Range Behavior‚Äù is registered only `Entry` class, and limited to only entries in the `events` section. You can see the behavior in use in the [homepage](templates/event.twig) and [event detail page](templates/index.twig) templates. 

- [modules/helpers/behaviors/DateRangeBehavior.php](modules/helpers/behaviors/DateRangeBehavior.php)

## Dashboard Widgets

I‚Äôve included two example dashboard widgets to demonstrate how widgets can be created, including storing state.

### Random Entry Widget

The ‚ÄúRandom Entry‚Äù widget queries all entries in all sections and surfaces a single random entry from across the site on each page load. The widget class specifies the widget‚Äôs name and renders a Twig template for the body. The body template performs the entry query and displays the result.

- [modules/helpers/widgets/RandomEntryWidget.php](modules/helpers/widgets/RandomEntryWidget.php)
- [modules/helpers/templates/widgets/random/body.twig](modules/helpers/templates/widgets/random/body.twig)

### Note to Self Widget

The ‚ÄúNote to Self‚Äù widget demonstrates how to store state alongside a widget instance. The widget class has a `$notes` property that is editable by the user. Because widget state is tied to a specific user‚Äôs instance of a widget, other users can have their own notes on their own widget. 

The widget body renders the note by accessing it from the widget instance. When the user toggles to the editing view, the widget instance renders the settings template, which uses Craft‚Äôs form macros to generate the form input.

- [modules/helpers/widgets/NotesWidget.php](modules/helpers/widgets/NotesWidget.php)
- [modules/helpers/templates/widgets/notes/body.twig](modules/helpers/templates/widgets/notes/body.twig)
- [modules/helpers/templates/widgets/notes/settings.twig](modules/helpers/templates/widgets/notes/settings.twig)

## Utility Types

I‚Äôve included an example widget similar to an example I mentioned in the talk.

### Connection Tester

The ‚ÄúConnection Tester‚Äù example shows non-functional UI for an example utility pane that tests the connection to important external services. The utility pane is rendered using a Twig template which outputs the table of services and statuses.

- [modules/helpers/utilities/ConnectionTester.php](modules/helpers/utilities/ConnectionTester.php)
- [modules/helpers/templates/utilities/connection-tester.twig](modules/helpers/templates/utilities/connection-tester.twig)

## Front-End Edit Link

The bottom of the main layout file includes an example of a front-end edit link. This link uses the entry‚Äôs type name in the link text, so the link reads "Edit Article" on articles, and "Edit Event" on events.

- [templates/_layout.twig](templates/_layout.twig)
